 * Adam Fuhram		Player Artist / Animation
 * Andrew Cho	    Turkey Artist / Animation

 * Creative Tilt:
 * - Programming:   Since I (Randy) was working with sprites that had drastically differing sizes and the size of 
 *                  the runner was important, I learned how to make edits to json files (Aseprite doesn't play nice
 *                  with different frame sizes) as well as making changes to the body. This was necessary so the
 *                  turkey would properly fly over the player, but also to prevent the player from falling through
 *                  the ground when attempting to slide. I also added a custom typeface to the game!
 * - Art:   We felt that pixel art best fit the gameplay of an arcade-styled project that is of a relatively small 
 *          scope. The artists of the team divided the work amongst ourselves. Andrew did the turkey and its 
 *          animations, as well as the title screen and the UI of the extra screens. Adam did the player and its 
 *          animations. I (Calvin) made the backgrounds, music, and found a typeface that best suited our artistic
 *          direction. Coordinating the size of the artwork got a bit difficult; we decided to scale the artwork; we
 *          made the dimensions of one “pixel” 3x3 rather than a true 1x1, so that the player could see the screen
 *          easier, and this caused some miscommunication in measurements along the way. We also had to navigate
 *          the issue of contrasting art styles and skill levels. Overall, we are quite pleased with the result,
 *          though there are aspects that have room for refinement.
